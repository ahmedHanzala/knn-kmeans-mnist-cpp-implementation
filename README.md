<h1>KNN and Kmeans Algorithms on MNIST in C++ from Scratch</h1>

 <p>This project demonstrates the implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and K-means algorithms from scratch in C++. It was developed as part of the second-semester coursework for the Object-Oriented Programming subject. This was made to have a lower-level understanding of how these machine learning algorithms work and to appreciate how elegantly pandas handles data and how much we should appreciate the library. This is a pandas appreciation repository :D </p>
  
  <h2>Project Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm</li>
    <li>Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm</li>
    <li>Support for custom distance metrics in KNN</li>
    <li>Ability to specify the number of clusters in K-means</li>
    <li>Interactive command-line interface for user interaction</li>
    <li>Efficient data structures and algorithms for optimal performance</li>
  </ul>
